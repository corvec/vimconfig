" set preserveindent
" searches ignore case unless the case is mixed
set ignorecase

" (l) Long lines are not broken in insert mode if they were already too long.

" It's added separately from the other options so that if it fails, they'll still be added.
" The 'silent!' command is used to prevent the error from appearing.
" NOTE: (o) gets added to my formatoptions for some reason, but if I explicitly remove it, it doesn't.
